### LEARN GO
# Gopher It
An effective way to learn something new is by making something! In this project we’re going to incorporate the use of fmt to make ASCII art. One suggestion is to make a gopher:

      `.-::::::-.`
  .:-::::::::::::::-:.
  `_:::    ::    :::_`
   .:( ^   :: ^   ):.
   `:::   (..)   :::.
   `:::::::UU:::::::`
   .::::::::::::::::.
   O::::::::::::::::O
   -::::::::::::::::-
   `::::::::::::::::`
    .::::::::::::::.
      oO:::::::Oo
But feel free to make what you want. In other words, gopher it.

Basic Go Structure
1.
Every Go program requires a package declaration, add in package main at the top of main.go.

2.
Now let’s import the packages that we need. In this case, we want to create ASCII art and print it to the terminal. Therefore, we want to import the "fmt" package.

Time to define the main function that will later house the code we need to print to the terminal.

Printing
4.
Inside the main function, we can use functions from the fmt package and print to the terminal. We’re already familiar with Println to print and add a new line each time.

fmt also has many other functions that we can explore. Remember, we can:

directly go to Go’s fmt package documentation.
enter the command go doc fmt.
use a search engine and find out more about fmt.
5.
After searching the different functions, let’s get to printing stuff!

You can print anything you want to the terminal, from messages to ASCII art:

  __      _
o'')}____//
 `_/      )
 (_(_/-(_/

If you want to re-create the gopher and need the template, check the hint!

7.
Click the Save button to save your code.

After saving, build an executable file and run that file to print out your ASCII art.

Or directly run the file, you decide!

Great job creating a Go program from scratch!

If you want to challenge yourself and learn more about Go:

Change the design of your ASCII art.
Add the time to show when your art was printed.
Use the time package.
Explore different time functions.
Explore different fmt functions (using go doc) and see what else you can print/do.
